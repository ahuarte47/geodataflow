It queries a set of dates of the <a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-2-l2a-cogs" target="_blank">Sentinel-2 L2A COG STAC Catalog</a>, cuts inputs rasters with the Area de Interest, calculates for each dataset its NDVI, then the workflow aggregates the "mean" of all pixels to finally export all rasters as Geotiffs, the TimeSeries plot as png and the Area of Interest as GeoJson.</p>
